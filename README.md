# ♻️ Smart Waste Management

A technology-driven solution to make waste collection, segregation and management more efficient, transparent and eco-friendly.  
This project was built as part of the Hackathon initiative.



## 🏆 Problem Statement
Urban and semi-urban areas face challenges in managing waste efficiently due to:
- Lack of real-time tracking of waste collection
- Poor segregation of recyclable vs non-recyclable waste
- Limited community participation
- Inefficient resource allocation



## 💡 Proposed Solution
Our system introduces:
- **IoT & Sensors** to track waste levels in bins  
- **Smart Dashboard** for monitoring and analytics  
- **Community Engagement** via reporting and awareness features  
- **Gamification & Rewards** to encourage responsible waste disposal  



## 📊 Flow of System
1. Waste bin sensors send data to the server  
2. Data is processed and shown on a community dashboard  
3. Notifications are sent to authorities and residents  
4. Community members can report issues directly via the platform  
5. Insights are generated for better planning and sustainability  



## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, CSS  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB / Firebase  
- **Other Tools:** GitHub, Docker, Cloud APIs
